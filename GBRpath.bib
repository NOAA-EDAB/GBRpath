	abstract = {1. Many recent statistical applications involve inference under complex models, where it is computationally prohibitive to calculate likelihoods but possible to simulate data. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is devoted to these complex models because it bypasses the evaluation of the likelihood function by comparing observed and simulated data. 2. We introduce the R package ‘abc’ that implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation and model selection. In particular, the recently developed nonlinear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The ‘abc’ package also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing model selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting tools. 3. R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The R package ‘abc’ will make the ABC algorithms available to a large number of R users. ‘abc’ is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.},

	abstract = {The Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Ecosystem is a dynamic environment. In
order to evaluate the response of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations and
to explore possible future scenarios, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) instituted
the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to
establish an ecological network model (i.e., a nuanced energy budget) of the entire NEUS
Ecosystem food web. The highly interdisciplinary EMAX work focused on four contemporary
(1996-2000) subregions of the ecosystem; designated 36 network nodes (biomass state variables)
across a broad range of the biological hierarchy; and incorporated a wide range of key rate
processes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes
in the ecosystem, and various model configurations were constructed and psuedo-dynamic
scenarios evaluated to explore how potential changes to this group can affect the rest of the food
web. Preliminary results show that small pelagic fishes are clearly keystone species in the
ecosystem. There are some differences across the four EMAX regions reflective of the local
biology, but major patterns of network properties are similar over space. EMAX will continue to
play a critical role in the further development of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) by
acting as a catalogue of information and data; identifying major fluxes among biotic components
of the ecosystem; serving as a basis for further analytical models; developing a way to evaluate
biomass tradeoffs; and acting as a backdrop for a suite of other relevant management and
research questions.},
