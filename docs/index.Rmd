## Georges Bank

Georges Bank is a highly productive sub-marine plateau located directly east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  The bank has a long history of commercial fishing and is currently the focus of an example Fisheries Ecosystem Plan (eFEP) for the New England Fisheries Management Council.  This repository will house all of the code that goes into creating a mass balance food web model version of Georges Bank.  The model will be built using [Rpath](http://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath), the R implementaion of the mass balance algorithms.
